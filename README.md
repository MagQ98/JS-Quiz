### Fixed Bugs or Issues
<ul>
<li>Encountered an issue on mobile screens with sizing. When the site was viewed on a mobile screen the highscore page was zoomed out and the Home button was pushed up and overlaping the Highscore call. I was able to correct this bug by reducing the padding on the content.</li>
<li>Encountered an issue with Javascript. I followed a tutorial initially but when I decided I would like 2 quizzes with different difficulties that meant I had to rewrite many functions because they werent applicable anymore</li>
</ul>
