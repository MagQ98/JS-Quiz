Design
======

### Structure
<p>The site is designed and structured in a way that is user friendly, easy to navigate and eye-catching. Upon clicking into the site, the user is greeted with a fun, colourful display and a centred logo and a navigation bar, containing four separate pages.</p>
<p>A home page containing an introduction to what the site is about and relevant information regarding sharks.</p>
<p>A facts page filled with 10 interesting facts.</p>
<p>A species page containing a gallery.</p>
<p>A donation page with relevant, trustworthy links to donate.</p>

### Color
<p>For the colour scheme blues, greys and whites were chosen to match the colours of images on the page and also the colour theme of sharks themselves</p>
<p>After deciding on the colour I tested them on WebAIM to make sure the contrast between them was right</p> 

### Typography
<p>Nova Square was the font used for all text in the game. The font was found on Googlefonts and was used because it was easy to read and because it matches the themes present in the Mass Effect franchse.</p>

Testing

## Validator Testing

### Html
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

### Css
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

### Fixed Bugs or Issues
<ul>
<li>Encountered an issue on mobile screens with sizing. When the site was viewed on a mobile screen the header was zoomed out and was left with a large white padding on the right side. I was able to correct this bug by changing the viewport initial scale to 0.5 instead of 1.</li>
<li>Encountered an issue with the facts page. When the facts were hovered on the zoom effect worked but in the process some of the content was pushed off screen and not viewable. I was able to fix this by reducing the padding on the content.</li>
<li>While creating my website, the original concept was to make the heading colors the same as the hero image picture color but when it was run through a contrast color checker WebAIM, it failed. So instead I had to choose a darker shade of blue for my overall theme which has a contrast ratio of 4.7:1.</li>
</ul>

Deployment

<p>The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps I used to deploy are as follows:</p>
<p>In my GitHub repository https://github.com/MagQ98/friends-of-fins, I navigated to the Settings tab</p>
<p>From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Master Branch</p>
<p>Once the master branch was selected, the page was automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.</p>
